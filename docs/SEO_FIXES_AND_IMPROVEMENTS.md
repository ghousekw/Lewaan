## 📋 Next Steps to Improve SEO Rankings

### 1. **Add More Content with Target Keywords** (HIGH PRIORITY)
Your pages need more keyword-rich content. Add these sections:

#### Homepage - Add a "Why Choose Lewan Interior" section with:

- **Content ideas**: 
  - "Why Lewan Interior is Kuwait's #1 choice"

### 2. **Fix Root Domain Issue** (CRITICAL)
Your homepage is at `/en/` not just `/`. Add a proper redirect page at `/`:

**Current issue**: When people type "lewan interior", Google's search results link to `lewaninterior.com/en/` which has the canonical pointing back, causing ranking confusion.

**Fix**: Ensure the root domain `/` has proper SEO tags.

**Check**: Your current `/index.astro` is just a redirect - it needs SEO optimization.

### 3. **Add Google Search Console & Analytics** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Add your site to Google Search Console to monitor:
  - Search queries ("lewan interior", "interior design kuwait", etc.)

- Social media (Instagram, LinkedIn)

### 5. **Optimize H1, H2, H3 Tags with Keywords** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

Create pages targeting specific Kuwait locations:
- "Interior Design in Kuwait City"

- etc.

Each page should target: "Lewan Interior Design in [Location]"
